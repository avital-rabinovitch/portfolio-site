*==WIP...==*

And so, on January 25, 2025 after many years of saying "she needs a resurrection", a resurrection was in fact on the agenda.

Who is she? She is this portfolio, or well she is what this "portfolio" will be a part of. 

I contain multitudes, details, and devilish ways that may one day land on a nice sparkling web page. Until then (as of now), this site will contain creative works or works keeping my creativity remain content. 

Confused? I probably am too--otherwise I would not be still building and percieving the portfolio passageway (aka the process of making this whole shebangabanga of a site).

# Let's Begin

The first draft of this site was created when the domino labeled as "my capstone class says I have four days to build and publish a portfolio" fell. 

The brief for my class--taught by [Allison Parish](https://www.decontextualize.com/)--was:

*Make a web-based portfolio of your work. Include at least three items in the portfolio. If you already have a web-based portfolio, make an experimental portfolio that takes a different approach from the portfolio you already have. Post a link to your portfolio on your blog. In addition, prepare a list of five or more portfolio sites that you admire.*

## Step 1. The Blog

I make a folder outside of projects called "blog" and make a corresponding page introducing as I would. And then I do some weird redundancy like things because I'm tired and though strange, it works. 

Result: the blog exists, the portfolio has a post, the post has a link, eventually I add the portfolios I admire

## Step N Portfolios I Admire
