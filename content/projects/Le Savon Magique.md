This was my final project for French my junior year  high of school. Not only was this when I first formally learned video production, but the entire process of writing the script, story-boarding, directing, and editing was done (or at least encourage to be done) while speaking French. I got  to produce this with some of the lovliest ladies in my high school class. And how could I forget the one shot I'm in: a blooper recorded the day we all took the AP Physics C exam.
