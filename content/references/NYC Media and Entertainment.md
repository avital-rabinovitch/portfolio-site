This is working document for those looking to showcase and entertain across New York City. I originally started this while working with my incredibly talented friend [Josh Witt](https://www.instagram.com/joshandthewittness/?hl=en). 

If you've stumbled upon this page or you were sent here: please, take advantage of what information is gathered thus far. Without art there is no vitality. Without music there is no emotion in the air. Go out and rage against the machine!
