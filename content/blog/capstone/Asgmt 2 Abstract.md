# Brief
### Assignment #2: Concept abstracts

*Due at the beginning of week 3 (2025-02-03). Based on our in-class exercises, compose three to five speculative abstracts for Capstone project ideas. Write these abstracts as though you have already completed the project in question. Each abstract should be 100–200 words and accompanied by at least one reference to a project, paper, article, talk, or other piece of media that is adjacent to the project idea. For each abstract, identify audiences, venues, publications, etc. that might be a good “fit.” Make a post on your blog with these abstracts.*

### Taking inventory

[Index card method](https://capstone.decontextualize.com/brainstorming/#strategies-for-project-ideas:~:text=This%20is%20an%20exercise%20with%20index%20cards.%20The%20goal%20is%20to%20figure%20out%20what%20you%E2%80%99re%20interested%20in%20and%20start%20to%20understand%20how%20those%20interests%20might%20be%20related%20to%20each%20other.) courtesy of Allison

> **Instructions**
> 
> 1. Get index cards
> 2. Write down a word or phrase that describes an interest, a technique, an aesthetic, etc. 
> 3. Taxonomize: Do the cards fall into categories? What's missing from those categories? Is there a category of interest that you missed entirely? Do any of the cards suggest other interests that you didnt include?
> 4. Generate new ideas: Pick the cards up, shuffle them and re-arrange them. Put two cards together at random to create new juxtapositions. What project ideas or areas of research suggest themselves?

### Mind map

> Steps:
> 
> - Pick a topic to explore.
> - Write your topic idea in the middle of a sheet of paper.
> - Make a list of related topics and write them around the central topic. (These topics might be related fields of research; research directions phrased as questions; techniques and materials; subtopics; free association; etc.) Connect to the original topic with a line.
> - For each of the new topics, repeat the process.
> - Try not to edit yourself too much. Use external resources (notes, Wikipedia, whatever) but don’t get bogged down in specifics.
> - Group “trees” visually with different colors, etc.
> - When you’re done, evaluate. What’s missing? Do any of the “subtopics” have relationships with each other? Where do you need to do more research?

# Writing abstracts

## Components



>Components of an abstract (not necessarily in this order):
> - **What** you did (“I present X, a Y that does Z”)
>- **Why** you did it (the research problem you're addressing)
>- **How** you did it (what **techniques** did you use? what were your **methodologies for evaluation**?)
>- The results (did it work? **how do you know**?)

 #### Reference to: [How to Write an Abstract](https://urc.ucdavis.edu/how-write-abstract) from UC Davis
 
> - The **purpose** of the project identifying the **area of study** to which it belongs.
> - The research **problem that motivates** the project.
> - The methods used to address this research problem, documents or evidence analyzed.
> - The **conclusions** reached or, if the research is in progress, what the preliminary results of the investigation suggest, or **what the research methods demonstrate**
> - The significance of the research project. **Why are the results useful**? **What is new to our understanding** as the result of your inquiry?


### Outline

Based on [suggested content structure by UC Davis](https://urc.ucdavis.edu/how-write-abstract#:~:text=Brief%20Background/Introduction,does%20it%20mean%3F)
