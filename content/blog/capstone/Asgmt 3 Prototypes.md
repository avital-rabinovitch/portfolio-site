### current abstract

*Feb 15, 2025*

Social interactions extend beyond diplomacy and personal development. Personal satisfaction and cultural growth directly depend on a human's environment containing social gatherings. In this study gatherings were defined as parties in private spaces or private invites in New York City that were not centered on food and at least had curated music playing for the event. This study studied how such gathering were promoted from the midcentury to now--noting the use of telephones, paper invites, and the use of the Internet both for email invites, web based invites (like on Eventbrite and partiful) and promoting on social media. This projected specifically asked what style of invitations best results in a tasteful invite experience. Moreover, the engagement metric of attendance and being overcapacity was weighed less than interviews with event hosts, talents, and promoters attributed as their current metrics for a successful event, The motivation for this was the notion that the event and business market is oversaturated and understanding that as long as enough attendees are there for the purpose of the event (eg. dancing at a DJ event or meeting at speedating) and the businesses do not lose money, it consistutes as a successful event for logistics purposes. But what about taste? Through iterating on different handheld invites inspired by ones found in archives from the 1990s magnetic invites were designed and produced to simulate and event promoter using a product that must be recieved by participants to attend the event. The product was designed both as a paper print, a magnet, and a wearable. It was then tested for aesthetic, for cognitive memory of event, and the emotional and narrative impact it had on the invitee. This study found that the novel way of building the modular magnetic model for the event was most uniquely effective as far as the narrative experience. However, the wearable was not as an emotionally satisfying experience because it was discomforting at times, but the invitees were more aware of the event and excited to come because it meant they could take the wearable off.
