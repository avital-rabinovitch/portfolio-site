# Notes

Source: [Annotated Bibliography from Allison Parish](https://capstone.decontextualize.com/lit-review/#annotated-bibliography)

In this class, your contextual review should result in an _annotated bibliography_. (Note: The "contextual review" process is ongoing! You shouldn't stop looking for references after you're done with this assignment.) The annotated bibliography is a list of **things that you found**, **cited** in appropriate bibliographic format, along with **a paragraph or two** that ==summarizes the source== and ==reflects on its importance for your own project==.

The purpose of the annotated bibliography is to help you ==direct your research== and to show to the instructor that you've been doing the reading. The annotated bibliography can also serve as a starting point for the "Related work'' section of your research paper.

# Process

By now, Feb 23, 2025: I have gathered some sources, I have conducted formal and informal interviews, I have attended events, and through all of that I have taken notes. These notes are a blend of reflection of what interests me, topics to explore based on self-directed research and recommendations from conversations, and personal testimony of the interviewees. 

I share in [[Asgmt 3 Prototypes#Informal Interview or Witnessing Convos|informal chats]] and [[Asgmt 3 Prototypes#Formal Interviews|interviews]] during the weeks of my initial prototypes mention of historical context including the grassroots evolvement from Lindy Hop emerging n the 1920 , to Doo Wop in the 40s, to Disco in the 60s, to hip hop in the 70s from my conversation with Josh Witt. Combined with my formal interview of stories and context with Rob Minniti with his experience with house scene in the 90s (of a music scene that started its original grass roots in the 80s), I had a collection of music that originates from the coined phrase "non scheduled events in active spaces" from grassroots local folks in urban spaces passionate about community and getting their ideas heard and feelings expressed. 

This set the ground for the topics of 20th and 21st century history in urban art, music, and culture.
