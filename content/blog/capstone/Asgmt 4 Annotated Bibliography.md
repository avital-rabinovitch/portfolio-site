# Process

By now, Feb 23, 2025: I have gathered some sources, I have conducted formal and informal interviews, I have attended events, and through all of that I have taken notes. These notes are a blend of reflection of what interests me, topics to explore based on self-directed research and recommendations from conversations, and personal testimony of the interviewees. 

I share in [[Asgmt 3 Prototypes#Informal Interview or Witnessing Convos|informal chats]] and [[Asgmt 3 Prototypes#Formal Interviews|interviews]] during the weeks of my initial prototypes mention of historical context including the grassroots evolvement from Lindy Hop emerging n the 1920 , to Doo Wop in the 40s, to Disco in the 60s, to hip hop in the 70s from my conversation with Josh Witt. Combined with my formal interview of stories and context with Rob Minniti with his experience with house scene in the 90s (of a music scene that started its original grass roots in the 80s), I had a collection of music that originates from the coined phrase "non scheduled events in active spaces" from grassroots local folks in urban spaces passionate about community and getting their ideas heard and feelings expressed. 

This set the ground for the topics of 20th and 21st century history in urban art, music, and culture.

> **Here's the Oxford English Dictionary definition of Subculture:**
> 
> An ==identifiable subgroup== **within** a ==society or group of people==, especially one ==characterized by beliefs or interests== at **variance** with ==those of the larger group==; the **distinctive** ==ideas, practices, or way of life== of such a subgroup.

###### ***Note to self:*** 

With each group I research, interview, or collaborate with for context or for practice collect a "==working distinction==" of their **variant**. 

Additionally, explore the intersection of ==grass roots and variants==. ^8ffa67
