# Brief


*Make a web-based portfolio of your work. Include at least three items in the portfolio. If you already have a web-based portfolio, make an experimental portfolio that takes a different approach from the portfolio you already have. Post a link to your portfolio on your blog. In addition, prepare a list of five or more portfolio sites that you admire.*


# Process

So my blog needed a link to the portfolio according to my class brief. I'll comply.

This is a "blog post" of ***portfolio: the assignment***

[This](index) is a link to the home page of ***portfolio: I think this is what this whole shebangang is***

And as if the sense of redundancy was not enough, [[Portfolio Passageway|this]] is a link to "Portfolio Passageway", what I'll be calling the journey of building this portfolio for now.

Having fun? Incredible.

## Projects in Portfolio

We were asked to add at least three projects to the portfoOooOOoolio (things are getting spooky yo). Here's a run down of what I added.

### 1. [[Portfolio Passageway]]

**What is it?** Redundant. I already added the link above. Confusing? Yes. Click the link to find out how the confusion *may never* stop

**Why did I add it?** I want to be accountable to have and to add to living project because it seems like the mature artist thing to do. Side effects include an obligatory cycle of documenting gestation and birth and death all at once--what will be conceived, perceived, deceived? The wilderness.

### 2. [[Audio Stories]]

**What is it?** Published stories I have on SoundCloud from some classes I have taken during my undergrad

**Why did I add it?** Outside of drawings--which seem to never full land on their feet as far as "yes this documented beauty is ready to appear as a jpeg"--my audio stories come second to the work I am most proud of in college. Again, I want to be accountable to build on that pride by remembering I have this quality work under my belt and not forgetting that producing more audio stories is probably going to improve my mental health.

### 3. [[Making Sense of Scents]]

**What is it?** An infographic retelling of a scientific paper from wayyyy back in high school. Attending a STEM magnet school meant I was in a scientific and technical writing course as a junior. As a project to practice distilling a published research paper in a visual and text format tailored for a middle school audience. 

**Why did I add it?** I really get into that in the project page because I have little remanence of my process of developing the infographic. However, the key reason is that I attribute that homework assignment as that turned the switch that has consistently influenced me as a communicator. I admire the ability to bridge content to any audience and to bridge attention to any cause. I want to use it for good. Let's find out what's good

## Porfolios I Admire

This was the last part of the portfolio homework brief. There is more I want to say and note on these websites as far as what inspires me or what I feel like works for what these creators appear to be achieving with how they have published their works. 

I love observing and analyzing. This section could be as endless as my ability to think. I'll let it be brief.
