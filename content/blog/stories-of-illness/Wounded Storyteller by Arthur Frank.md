# Response

## Reflection and Creative Practice Proposal

### brief

*Make: respond to a theme in this week;s reading through the framework of either experiencing or witnessing (ie. an experience or witnessing of narrative wreckage / an experiencing or witnessing of the restitution narrative, etc.) Your work can take any form - written, performative, visual, poetic, still, time-based, etc. Please think of it as an exercise and/or response.  Be prepared to discuss in class. (Due 1 week - Class 2 1/30)*
*Complete the following introductory survey.*

### submission (Jan 30, 2025)

*Due to time constraints from balancing enhancing the technical skills for my "make" response, the production execution, and acute person (and synchronous medical) things in my and even my dog's life, the following response is a description of what it is I want to execute, the inspiration, and--of course--a reflection.*

Restitution, chaos, and quest narratives. Witnessing my own journey of illness and gaps of welfare. A ritual to process the experience and grieve with my memory. These are the three elements that I wanted to document for this reading response.

The three kinds of narrative all share this idea that though we live in that now and move forward--as if to experience a linear narrative--the experiences when witnessing illnesss, espsecially one's own, are not smooth step-by-steps. They are also not all calm, they are not all comprehensible, and they most all are certainly based in some reality. That reality for me comes a large part from what it is I am "grappling to" outside of the facts of daily living, outside of the facts and feelings of inner being. 

October 2022. An ex formally introduced me to the music of Depeche Mode. I recognized "Just Can't Get Enough", found the poetics of "Strange Love" worth lyrical praise, and could not stop smiling at how much "A Pain that I'm Used to" represented a part of my angry psyche that I am not sure will ever fully resolve the abusrdity of survival. For a while survival lived near a boundary. The side of accessibility felt like it needed a key of better self-management. And the side of imprisonment felt like it needed "one more bad slip." 

I broke my knee in October. Fuck yeah I played that song on repeat.

I eventually, left NYC, tried finding better medical and PTSD care in Boston, moved in with my parents, fled my parents, and could be found rage pacing around Cambridge with my lavish punk mug on. I was more than getting by by eventually making a ritual of listening to the entire album "A Pain that I'm Used to" is on. The 2007 album *Playing an Angel*.

This album ritual simply got me to a bed some days. A form of restitution -- "I'll have somewhere to sleep tonight." It gave me a safe space for the anger in my mind to have a chance of sensory auditory equilibrium. The chaos then turns to quest because without that I am not able to even define the pain in my mind. Have an awareness--even if not with words--is the first step to develop acceptance, growth, and an evolution I cannot even fathom at the time of the pain.

I wanted to make an ode to my collection of pain. Taking a linear listening habit and transferring it into a remix of parts of my track that layover nicely to the kinds of wound that need screaming before the emotional scabs can dampen their cries. 
 
I was going to have the audio (continued to mixed in Ableton if the trial doesn't expire or mixed in Reaper if I determine the necessary plug ins) be the soundtrack to a birds eye view shot of a time lapse of me drawing on a roll of paper. Likely a set up of using my iPhone 13 camera with the [Peak Design Mobile Developer Kit](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/creator-kit?variant=39475535577165&g_acctid=994-161-7175&g_adgroupid=&g_adid=&g_adtype=none&g_campaign=2+-+QRY+-+Consideration+-+Performance+Max+-+Brand+-+NYC&g_campaignid=21026855488&g_keyword=&g_keywordid=&g_network=x&nb_adtype=pla&nb_ap=&nb_fii=&nb_kwd=&nb_li_ms=&nb_lp_ms=&nb_mi=105553808&nb_mt=&nb_pc=online&nb_pi=M-CK-AA-BK-1&nb_placement=&nb_ppi=&nb_ti=&nbt=nb%3Aadwords%3Ax%3A21026855488%3A%3A&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA4-y8BhC3ARIsAHmjC_HaM_VItCW9MBSt5YJdJbHD7r9eWSix4T-nCpK2XlVv9QPCNgQ5eicaAmBVEALw_wcB). I have some [Strathmore](https://www.dickblick.com/items/strathmore-400-series-smooth-surface-drawing-paper-roll-42-x-10-yds/?clicktracking=true&wmcp=pla&wmcid=items&wmckw=13651-1042&country=us&currency=usd&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA4-y8BhC3ARIsAHmjC_FijOBVrXWw8_GXFC1_LvO7W5fqQi8mXTYvBccwm5U2o3poJO_HIdoaAthiEALw_wcB) paper. 

The album is available on the [Internet Archives](https://archive.org/details/DepecheModePlayingTheAngel) or listening and even download (Creative Commons license). I got as far as starting a multi track and syncing up the BPM of A Pain that I'm Used to's flute like synths with the bass track of Suffer Well. Planning on using some lyrics but perhaps more of the instrumental tracks available. In Suffer Well I plan on using the lyrics of the second verse, "*I found treasure not where I thought/Peace of mind can't be bought/Still, I believe*" and chorus, "I *just hang on, suffer well/Sometimes it's hard, it's hard to tell*" 

The visuals would be whatever comes out. Ideally I'd have some of the track I would edit after to hit some of the beats of the drawing. The drawing would be as I say, "in my style." My painter friend, Abby Rhose who is a yogi and familair with somatics has described my work saying "It  conveys a sense or state of being experientially. The drawings feel fluid like in an emotional sense."

My ex who introduced me to Depeche Mode described my visual style as, "Images akin to how querents in my business describe their nightmares."

I think they meant all feelings and dreams ðŸ˜‰

*an example...i am collecitng my drawings*

These drawings bring out characters I feel within my multitudes and my narrative as antagonists, allies, and so forth. And yes, they come out with fluidity. Sometimes in a neutral headspace, sometimes in intense emotion. I look forward to see where the audio and drawing develops and bridges this ritual that helped me witness my own illness, pain, joy, and confusion.
