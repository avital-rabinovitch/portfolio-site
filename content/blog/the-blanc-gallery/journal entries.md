## Brief

## Response

What do you most like to ponder? What does your mind meander about? 
- Origins, connections, implications
- Where did this originate?
- How does it connect with the things it influence and what’s the underlying synthesis between those connections and the influence itself 
- What is the origin and variety in curiosity? Is anybody curious for curiosity sake?
- Documentation, middle school media, gaps and peaks of talent and skill that makes me feel like valleys and mountains don’t know who is who
What kinds of interactive technologies/media are you most drawn to? Why? What is it about them?
- Spaces that facilitate sensory experiences that promote intimacy. They don’t even need to be foreign or hyper-experimental. In fact I think designing a series of lounge rooms that are curated for comfort and digesting documentary information may be more effective and meaningful ti tell the stories I want to tell
- I strive to bring content to any audience and bring attention to any cause that aligns with me at a point of space and time. Blending comfort with boldness and humility is a way to communicate that  
What kinds of interactive technologies/media are you most scared of/concerned about/have questions about? Why?
- Screens are being tastelessly used buy and large
- Buzzwords are being thrown around whether by performers, developers, or consumers saying things are accessible or digestible without much evidence or testimony. You say it is so it is? Well I see more ways it isn’t? Where is the space for humble conflict and resolution?
- With the rise of hyper pop and bring a sense of “overwhelm” in a vintage and future way things are genuinely hard to read or feel. So many posters have landed on my feed and I think “i wish instead of digitally building the graphic they actually did the cut and paste from a magazine as they’re trying to mimic. The legibility would help me see where the show is. The process would bring back the vintage with the reality of the new age”
- We have raves with our radiant context because screens are so easy to eat that people are forgetting what it feels like to be hungry at breakfast
